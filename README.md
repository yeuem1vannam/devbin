# devbin

Working in multiple containerized environment seamlessly. Within the application folder, type one command, give the name of other application, then it should work.

## Motivation
When working in a multiple containerized environment, it gets boring to repeatedly make `cd` back and forth between application's folders to execute some commands.  
The Convention-Over-Configuration pattern is quite popular this day, we all name our containers, arrange folders base on some predictable rules, then make some command alias for faster integrate with other containers. **devbin** will help us to bootstrapping + managing our environment seamlessly.

The idea is: just remember the application name + the command you want to execute, **devbin** do all other boring things.

```text
samples
├── app-one
│   ├── Gemfile
│   ├── Gemfile.lock
│   └── app.rb
├── app-two
│   ├── Gemfile
│   ├── Gemfile.lock
│   └── app.rb
├── docker
│   └── docker-compose.yml
└── docker-sync.yml
```

With **devbin**, you can stay at `samples/app-one` or `samples` and control the stack seamlessly:
```sh
$ devbin rails s app-one --detach
$ devbin rails s app-two
```

## Installation

Install gem as as:
```sh
$ gem install devbin
```

## Usage
TL; DR;

```sh
$ devbin help
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
